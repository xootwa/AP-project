Drink Ordering System

CaribResort is an all-inclusive hotel on the north coast in Jamaica. The manager in the hotel wants to keep track of the daily frequency that any specific drink is ordered. If a guest has on an orange armband, he/she is over 18 years of age can order any drink, otherwise the guest is under 18 and cannot order alcoholic drinks. All armbands contain a small RFID tag that indicates the type. When a guest orders a drink, the order goes to the bartender and the drink will be taken to the guest seated at the bar.

Drink Order Module

The guest should be able to order a drink or multiple drinks from the electronic menu at the table he or she is seated at (recall the armband rule). When the bartender receives the order he should changed the status from open to served.
